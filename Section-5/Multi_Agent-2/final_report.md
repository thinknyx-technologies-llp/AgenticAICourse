**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer
**FROM:** Head of Operations
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Executive Summary: Action Plan to Reduce Support Costs and Improve Customer Satisfaction

### **1. Executive Summary**

Analysis of recent customer support data reveals significant operational inefficiencies and a trend of growing customer frustration. These issues are primarily driven by a high volume of unresolved **login issues**, a broken product feedback loop, and a reactive approach to common, preventable problems. This report outlines three strategic initiatives focused on overhauling self-service tools, implementing a robust agent diagnostic process, and formalizing how we capture customer feedback. Executing this plan is projected to significantly reduce ticket volume, decrease average resolution times, and directly improve customer satisfaction and retention.

### **2. Key Findings & Business Risks**

Our operations face three primary challenges that are inflating costs and degrading the customer experience:

*   **Login Issues are the Primary Operational Drag:** Representing the highest ticket volume (50) and an unacceptably long average resolution time of 48 hours, this single issue is the main driver of negative customer sentiment. The root causes are a confusing password reset interface and our agents' inability to reproduce user errors.
*   **Broken Product Feedback Loop:** Feature requests (20 tickets) are frequently closed with no resolution, creating a "black hole" for valuable customer insights. This frustrates our most engaged users and prevents the Product team from leveraging direct customer feedback.
*   **Reactive Support Model is Inefficient:** High call volume for routine issues like Account Verification demonstrates a failure of our self-service strategy. We are forcing users to contact support for problems that should be resolved through proactive, scalable resources, leading to unnecessary operational strain.

### **3. Strategic Recommendations & Action Plan**

To address these bottlenecks, we recommend a three-pronged approach focused on immediate and sustainable improvements.

**Recommendation 1: Overhaul the Login & Password Reset Experience to Deflect Tickets**
This initiative targets our highest-volume issue to reduce costs and customer frustration simultaneously.
*   **Action 1.1:** Initiate a UX/UI audit of the password reset flow to create a simple, guided self-service experience.
*   **Action 1.2:** Equip the support team with a session-replay tool to eliminate the "cannot reproduce" problem and implement a mandatory "Login Issue Triage Checklist" to standardize troubleshooting.
*   **Action 1.3:** Establish a strict 2-hour SLA for escalating unresolved login issues to Tier 2 technical support.

**Recommendation 2: Establish a Formal "Voice of the Customer" Program**
This initiative closes the loop between customer feedback and product development, turning support insights into a strategic asset.
*   **Action 2.1:** Implement a new process to tag, track, and route all feature requests to a dedicated Product backlog, replacing the current "close without resolution" practice.
*   **Action 2.2:** Institute a bi-weekly review meeting between Support and Product leadership to analyze customer feedback trends and inform the product roadmap.
*   **Action 2.3:** Configure automated email updates to inform customers of the status of their suggestions (e.g., "Under Review," "Planned"), demonstrating that their feedback is valued.

**Recommendation 3: Implement Proactive & Scalable Support Solutions**
This initiative focuses on prevention to reduce the volume of repetitive, low-value support interactions.
*   **Action 3.1:** Develop and prominently feature a knowledge base with step-by-step articles and video tutorials for our top 3 recurring issues (Password Reset, Account Verification, Billing Discrepancies).
*   **Action 3.2:** Deploy in-app guidance (e.g., tooltips) for the account verification process and trigger automated help emails after multiple failed login attempts.

### **4. Expected Business Impact**

*   **Reduced Operational Costs:** A projected 30-40% reduction in login-related tickets and faster resolution times will decrease agent hours and lower cost-per-contact.
*   **Improved Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) & Retention:** Directly addressing the primary sources of user frustration will lead to higher CSAT scores and reduced churn.
*   **Data-Driven Product Development:** Creating a formal feedback channel provides the Product team with prioritized, data-backed insights to build a better product.

### **5. Next Steps**

*   **Week 1:** Kick-off meeting with Product and Engineering leads to scope the UX audit and session-replay tool implementation.
*   **Week 2:** Support leadership to draft the new process documentation for the Triage Checklist and Feature Request workflow.
*   **Week 4:** Present a detailed project plan with timelines and resource requirements for final approval.
