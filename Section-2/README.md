## Section 2 - Project 1 – Weather AI Agent from Scratch

### Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build a minimal yet powerful Weather Agent from scratch using the Google Gemini model and an external Weather API - without relying on any agent frameworks.
The agent takes a natural-language question like “What’s the weather in Paris today?”, extracts the city name using the LLM, queries a weather API, and then combines the raw data with the original question to generate a clear, human-friendly response.

It’s a practical example of how an agent’s operational layer works — connecting language understanding, reasoning, and real-world tools to produce intelligent outputs.
