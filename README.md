## **What’s in this course?**

We begin with the **core foundations of Agentic AI** - understanding what agents are, how they differ from traditional AI systems, and how reasoning, planning, and tool usage enable autonomous workflows.

From there, we explore the **building blocks of agentic systems**, including **LLMs, memory, embeddings, vector databases, and RAG pipelines**. You’ll learn how agents reason, how they use tools, and how to structure prompts and task orchestration for optimal performance.

Next, we move into **advanced, real-world demonstrations**, where you will build practical agentic solutions such as:

* Standalone AI Agents
* An **MCP Server and Client Agent**
* **Multi-Agent Systems using CrewAI**
* An **AWS Monitoring Multi-Agent System**
* A **Cross-Cloud Multi-Agent System using AWS and Google Cloud**
* **Agentic RAG systems for intelligent knowledge retrieval**
* A **Course Intelligence Agent using Agentic RAG**
* A **Project Feasibility Analysis Agent powered by Agentic RAG**

These demonstrations simulate real enterprise and startup use cases, helping you understand how agentic AI systems are designed, scaled, and deployed in production environments.

---

## **By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:**

* Build autonomous AI agents from scratch
* Use **Smolagents, MCP, CrewAI, and n8n** to create production-grade agentic systems
* Integrate **RAG, memory systems, embeddings, and tool-based reasoning**
* Design **multi-agent workflows** where agents collaborate intelligently
* Build cloud-aware and cross-cloud agentic systems
* Deploy agents using **Docker or cloud environments**
* Implement **guardrails, safety, debugging, and reflection-based optimization**
* Build scalable, real-world automation powered by Agentic AI

---

## **Special Note**

This course is **highly practical** - packed with real demonstrations, hands-on projects, troubleshooting scenarios, and end-to-end agent-building exercises.

You won’t just learn how agents work—you’ll **build them, optimize them, and deploy them** in real-world applications.
